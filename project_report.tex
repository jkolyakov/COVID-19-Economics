\title{CSC110 Project Report: Effect of COVID-19 Cases on the Economy} % TODO: come up with a better title

\begin{document}
\maketitle

\section*{Introduction}

% TODO: the report suggests that we use the problem description and research question as a base for this section
% rereading that paragraph from the project proposal, it's probably best that we rewrite most of it to stay nice
% and clear

\section*{Dataset Description}

% TODO: this needs to be updated to include our expanded dataset (if we end up using it)
% this one can probably be just copy paste from the project proposal

\section*{Computational Overview}

% TODO: Adapt the computational plan, based on what we end up actually making

\section*{Usage Instructions}

% TODO: how does the TA get the data and then use the assignment so they're able to actually grade it

\section*{Discussion}

% TODO: write the discussion section
% from my understanding, this is mainly about did we answer the research question and next steps.
% this part doubles as the conclusion

\raggedright % fix overflowing right margin by allowing ragged entries
%\section*{References}
% biblatex bibliography adds references heading
\printbibliography

% NOTE: LaTeX does have a built-in way of generating references automatically,
% but it's a bit tricky to use so we STRONGLY recommend writing your references
% manually, using a standard academic format like APA or MLA.
